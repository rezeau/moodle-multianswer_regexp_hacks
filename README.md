# moodle-multianswer_regexp_hacks
This set of 4 files will enable you to use my REGEXP question type inside a cloze/multianswer question. 

Download the multianswer_regexp_hacks.zip file to your computer; unzip and copy the 4 php files to YOURMOODLE/question\type\multianswer folder where they will replace the existing PHP files of the same name.

Before doing that you shoud copy & save those Moodle default files somewhere, so you can revert things if needed.

Be extremely careful and only use those hacks if you know what you are doing.
